    title: "Seal Document with Blockchain"
    # info: "On this page you can generate an independently verifiable timestamp (= seal) for your documents for free. Every time the first known timestamp for the document will be displayed."
    info: | 
        Here's the safest and easiest place to protect your data and documents. Whether piece of music, photo, 
        algorithm or other information worthy of protection - thanks to Blockchain technology, your information 
        is 100% anonymous, 100% tamper-proof and 100% legally binding.
        </br></br>
        <em>Why its great:</em> We do not store any of your information, but at the same time provide you with a legally sound proof.
        </br></br>
        <em>Tip for all curious:</em> Test it now with any sample document or <a href='https://seal.ownyourdata.eu/en?hash=006748c21efaf8fe67b833d82cba7955619c3c3b06e11ed6562fbf6a1cb06f2c'>check out an existing document</a>!
